At the start of any adventure, I make a point of appreciating life's simple pleasures. Feet on land, check. Happy stomach, check. Celebratory beer before alighting on dry ship, check. I’m ready to go! Are we leaving? No. There’s an industrial dispute about who’s going to put our container on the boat so we’re not leaving till tomorrow midday by the sounds of things. In the mean time, let me show you around.

A little background about my home for the next two weeks. The Southern Surveyor was built in 1972 by Ranger Callisto in the UK it was bound for the north sea as a fishing vessel. In 1988 CSIRO bought the ship and converted it to a research ship. Since 2002 the ship has been administered by the Marine National Facility.
