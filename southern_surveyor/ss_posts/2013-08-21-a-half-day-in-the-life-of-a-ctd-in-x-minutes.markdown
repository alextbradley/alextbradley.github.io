Ever looked up ocean in the [guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy&oldid=603307712)? "Ocean," it says, "is big. Really big.

In other exciting news, I've discovered the secret of navigating the rabbit warren that is the lower decks of the ship. Imagine the following situation.
