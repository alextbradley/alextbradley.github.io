By all accounts, it's been a resounding success. I didn't spew once! Moreover, moorings of concern, namely 3/4, came back without a problem. More broadly, all the science objectives were met (some were exceeded). Here's some impressive facts. We retrieved 17 km of mooring line with over 150 sensors on the 5 moorings. The CTD winch payed (in and out) 171 km of wire for the 28 CTDs of the voyage. As my first voyage at sea I can't imagine better conditions; the weather has been perfect. The food and company have been excellent. And most importantly, I won 3/5 games of [Carcassonne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game))!
