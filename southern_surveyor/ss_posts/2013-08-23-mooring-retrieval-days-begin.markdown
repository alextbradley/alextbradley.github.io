Today is an exciting day, we've just started retrieving our first mooring. I wanted to take this opportunity to explain what a mooring actually is. For our experiment we have deployed five moorings to monitor the East Australia Current, our mooring array looks like…

**What does each item record? How much do they cost?**

**Starmon mini**

Records: temperature and no pressure

Sample time: five minutes

Response time: 30 seconds

Accuracy: 50/1000 degree

Cost: $800

**Seabird SBE37SMP**

Records: pressure, temperature and conductivity.

Sample time: ten minutes

Response time: milliseconds

Accuracy: 1/1000 degree

Cost: $8,000

**Aquadopp**

Records: single point current, temperature, pressure and depth

Sample time and output: every 30 seconds to output an average every 30 minutes

Accuracy: 100/1000 degree

Cost: $16,000

**Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)**

Records: velocity profile and pressure

3 different sorts:



	
  1. WH300 and BB150



	
  * Range: 300/150 metres (respectively). Price: $40,000-50,000



	
  1. LR 75



	
  * Range: 600 metres. Price: $80,000.


Sample time and output: every 15 minutes to output average hourly

**Acoustic release (two on every mooring for redundancy) **

[Function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_release): when release signal is detected, anchor is detached from mooring so that the buoyancy on the mooring makes the mooring float to the surface.[

Cost: $18,000

**Buoyancy**

Benthos glass floats ($600-800 each) and syntactic spheres ($12,000-$18,000). We can see what a syntactic spheres looks like in the ADCP picture above. The wire costs $3.15 a metre and the Dynex $3.45 a metre.

**Exeos equipment**

Function: help locate the mooring when the top is at the surface.

Instruments are: led flasher, vhf beacon and sable (gps) -- $1500, $1500 and $8000 respectively.
