One quick tip, **this blog runs newest to oldest**, so if you want to read from the start, when I didn’t know port from starboard, **scroll to the bottom**.



Special thanks to the following people (alphabetically): Aaron Buckleton, Alicia Navidad, Alvin Stone, Andreas Marouchos, Bernadette Sloyan, Danny Mclaughlan, Hugh Barker, Jamie Derrick, John Boyes, Ken Ridgway, Mike Sinclair, Mike Yorke-Barber, Nick Fleming, Pamela Brodie, Peter Dunn, Phil Adams, Rebecca Cowley, Rebecca Lee, Sarah Schofield, Simon Smeaton, Sue Reynolds and Willem Huiskamp. I’d also like to acknowledge the support of [Marine National Facility](http://www.marine.csiro.au/nationalfacility/), [UNSW Learning and Teaching Unit](http://teaching.unsw.edu.au/media) and [ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science](http://www.climatescience.org.au/) for filming.
