I am a postdoctoral researcher at the British Antarctic Survey and a David MacKay Cambridge Zero reseach associate at the University of Cambridge.   

I use numerical, statistical, and analytic methods to answer questions relating to the cryosphere. I use models, from simple schematic models to large general circulation models, to address questions relating to the changes we observe and to simulate those that may occur in the future. I am also interested in the public policy implications associated with a changing cryosphere. You can find out more about my interests from the ['research' tab](research.md).  

I previously completed undergraduate, masters and doctoral degrees in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I completed my dPhil in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Dominic Vella](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/vella/index.html) and [Prof. Ian Hewitt](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hewitt/).  

My work has been featured in, amongst others, [physicsworld](https://physicsworld.com/a/droplets-move-through-narrow-channel-by-bending-the-walls/), [nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00701-0), [phys.org](https://phys.org/news/2019-02-liquid-channel.html),and [Physics](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/18).

My header photo is from the Iezer-PÃ¢pusa mountain range in Romania. Each page on the website has a different cover photo from somewhere in the mountains; they can be seen all together here (coming soon).
