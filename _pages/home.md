I am a postdoctoral researcher at the British Antarctic Survey. My research focuses on ice-ocean interactions and their implications for ice sheets. I aim to improve our understanding of a wide variety of phenomena related to ice-ocean interactions, including the physical processes that occur at the interface between ice-shelves and adjacent ocean, the implications of ice-ocean interactions of the large scale response of ice sheets, and the consequences of such responses, particularly in the context of attributing changes in Antarctica to climate change. I am also interested in the public policy implications associated with a changing cryosphere. To address these questions, I use a wide variety of techniques, including asymptotic analysis, schematic models, statistics, numerical ice sheet models, and general circulation models. You can find out more about my interests from the ['research' tab](research.md).  

I previously completed undergraduate, masters and doctoral degrees in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I completed my dPhil in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Dominic Vella](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/vella/index.html) and [Prof. Ian Hewitt](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hewitt/). I held previous academic positions as a David MacKay Cambridge Zero reseach associate at the University of Cambridge and a visiting research fellow at Stanford Universty.
