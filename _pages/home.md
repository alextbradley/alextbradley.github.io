I am a Lecturer (~Assistant Professor) in Climate and Environmental Science at King's College London. I am a climate scientist, specialising in climate modelling and uncertainties in climate model predictions. To do so, I use mathematical and computational modelling, geophysical observations, data science, and machine learning. You can find out more about my research in the [research](https://alextbradley.github.io/research/). 

Prior to this, I was a postdoc at at the British Antarctic Survey. During this time, I also held academic positions as a David MacKay Cambridge Zero reseach associate at the University of Cambridge and a visiting research fellow positions at Stanford Universty and King's College London. I completed undergraduate, masters and doctoral degrees in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I completed my dPhil in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Dominic Vella](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/vella/index.html) and [Prof. Ian Hewitt](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hewitt/).
