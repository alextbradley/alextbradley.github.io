I am a postdoctoral researcher at the British Antarctic Survey and a visiting research fellow at King's College London. My research aims to understand the processes responsible for driving ice sheet retreat, better constrain past and future ice sheet change, and examine the implications of a changing cryosphere on societies around the world. To do so, I use mathematical and computational modelling, geophysical observations, data science, and machine learning. 

I previously completed undergraduate, masters and doctoral degrees in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I completed my dPhil in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Dominic Vella](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/vella/index.html) and [Prof. Ian Hewitt](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hewitt/). I held previous academic positions as a David MacKay Cambridge Zero reseach associate at the University of Cambridge and a visiting research fellow at Stanford Universty.
