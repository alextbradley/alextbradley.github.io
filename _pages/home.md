I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Modelling Group of the Ice Dynamics and Paleoclimate team at the British Antarctic Survey and a David MacKay Cambridge Zero reseach associate at the University of Cambridge. I am currently working with [Dr Rosie Williams](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hewitt/) and [Dr Rob Arthern](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/rart/) on developing methods to quantify the retreat of Western Antarctica in the context of anthropogenic forcing. You can find out more about this project and other research interest from the 'research' tab at the top.

Before moving to BAS, I completed undergraduate, masters and doctoral degrees in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I completed my dPhil in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Dominic Vella](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/vella/index.html) and [Prof. Ian Hewitt](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hewitt/).
