I am a postdoctoral researcher at the British Antarctic Survey and a David MacKay Cambridge Zero reseach associate at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on ice-ocean interactions and their implications for ice sheets. I aim to improve our understanding of a wide variety of phenomena related to ice ocean interactions, including the physical processes that occur at the interface between ice-shelves and
adjacent ocean, the implications of ice-ocean interactions of the large scale response of ice sheets, and the consequences of such responses in the context of attributing changes in Antarctica to climate change. I am also interested in the public policy implications associated with a changing cryosphere. To address these questions, I use a wide variety of techniques, including asymptotic analysis, schematic models, statistics, numerical ice sheet models, and general circulation models. You can find out more about this project and my other research interests from the ['research' tab](research.md).

Before moving to BAS, I completed undergraduate, masters and doctoral degrees in Mathematics at the University of Oxford. I completed my dPhil in 2020, under the supervision of [Prof. Dominic Vella](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/vella/index.html) and [Prof. Ian Hewitt](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/hewitt/).
