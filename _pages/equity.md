_It will require intentional effort on [the part of white men]...to circumnavigate the oppressive system they are equally as embedded in as those who are oppressed"_ (Darcy and Hodari, 2022)

It is the responsibility of those with the most privilege (typically white, cis-gendered heterosexual males, a group with which I identify) to make changes to the systems and power structures which support that privilege. Here is a list of resources I have found useful in examining my own privilege. Recommendations of further resources are very much appreciated. Below, I have included a list of activities undertaken in the name of equity (coming soon); this is not to 'virtue signal' or an act of performative outrage, but rather to be accountable for the intentional effort I am putting in to challenge the power structures and provide ideas to others who might be looking to shine a spotlight on their own privilege. This list is in progress; if you have recommendations, please don't hesitate to [email me](mailto:alextbradley@gmail.com)
