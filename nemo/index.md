Blog posts that describe the journey of building a regional configuration of NEMO 3.6 "WED12" on [ARCHER](http://www.archer.ac.uk/). These posts assume that the process is followed start to finish (oldest to newest) and are *strongly* based on [Nicolas Jourdain's](https://nicojourdain.github.io/) [BUILD_NEMO_CONFIG](https://github.com/nicojourdain/BUILD_CONFIG_NEMO), we will follow this [fork](https://github.com/chrisb13/BUILD_CONFIG_NEMO).
